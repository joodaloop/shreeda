I'm no professional. Insofar as I do care about good design, it is for the straightforward purpose of making things that are more beautiful than not. Any rules I have are usually stolen, and weilded lightly. 


At first glance, it seems like a dry discipline, filled with rather boring rules about line-widths and parargraph spacings. 

But the effect that a simple font change can have is oft-underrated, and the first step in my process usually involves finding one that fits the vibe of the project. The idea that good typography should be "invisible" is a [flawed](https://practicaltypography.com/drowning-the-crystal-goblet.html) one.
