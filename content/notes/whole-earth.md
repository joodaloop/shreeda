Whenever someone asks me for coffee/chat/advice I normally end up saying random useless nonsense in the moment but then emailing a couple of days later saying "Actually, this book/quote/link might be useful for that thing you were wondering about." I have a large collection of that stuff, scattered across this blog, various google docs, Pinboard and Readwise. It's a sort of distributed commonplace book. I've recently wondered whether I could just dispense with the coffee stuff and share the whole collection in some useful way. And I've been wondering how to get it all together. I tried Scrivener, so it could be a book and Roam, so it could be networked and modern and Obsidian, so it could look like a spaceship. But none of them seemed to stick.

But the effect that a simple font change can have is oft-underrated, and the first step in my process usually involves finding one that fits the vibe of the project. The idea that good typography should be "invisible" is a [flawed](https://practicaltypography.com/drowning-the-crystal-goblet.html) one. er someone asks me for coffee/chat/advice I normally end up saying random useless nonsense in the moment but then emailing a couple of days later saying "Actually, this book/quote/link might be useful for that thing you were wondering about."

In moments of doubt, I simply return to the [question](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/vibe-driven-development/): *"does this look like I want it to?"*
